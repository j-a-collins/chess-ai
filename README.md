Training a Neural Net to play chess

Having recently been reading Deep Thinking by Garry Kasparov; this program
will aim to explore some of the ideas he defines as Type A and Type B chess
programs:

(i) Formulate a tree data structure for move-searching, and;
(ii) Utilise a NN to collapse the search tree formulated in (i) based on
historical games from a database of PGN chess games (from
https://database.lichess.org).
